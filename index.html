      My favorite hobby is playing sports because it is very fun and that too it helps my body to exercise. I play lots of sports such as Basketball, Soccer, Tennis, Baseball, and much more. This impacts my life alot actually because i got diabetes and it makes my blood sugar go low. therefore i play sports much less now but I still love doing it out of all sports I love basketball I am really good at handling the ball within my hand grip and shooting but i need to improve more on passing and defense. My favorite basketball players go in this order<br>1.Kobe Bryant<br> 2. Micheal Jordan <br> 3. Steph Curry <br>4. Kyrie Irving <br> 5. Shaq O'neal
